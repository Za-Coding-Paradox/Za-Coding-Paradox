# Hi, I'm [Your Name] 👋

I’m a developer deeply interested in **Systems Programming** and the logical puzzles of **Discrete Mathematics**. I prefer building things from the ground up to understand how they work at the byte level.

---

### 🛠 What I’m Building Right Now
* **[Project Name - e.g., DMSA]:** An automation system for discrete math. Currently working on [specific feature like "multi-argument analysis"].
* **[Project Name - e.g., Memory Allocator]:** A custom C++ allocator designed for [specific goal like "low-latency" or "learning memory layouts"].
* **[Project Name - e.g., Map Generator]:** Procedural world generation focusing on [specific detail like "algorithmic consistency" or "Indus Valley themes"].

### 🧠 Core Interests & Research
* **Low-Level Systems:** Memory management, performance optimization, and understanding the "why" behind the code.
* **Discrete Math:** Combinatorics, Number Theory, and turning mathematical proofs into executable logic.
* **Developer Experience:** Building a streamlined workflow within **Neovim** and the terminal.

### 💻 My Environment & Tools
* **Languages:** C++, [Add others here]
* **Frontend/Tools:** React, Vite, Firebase
* **Editor:** Neovim (LSP, Mason, and a lot of custom config)
* **OS/Terminal:** [e.g., Linux/MacOS, Zsh/Bash]

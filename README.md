# Hi, I'm Za-Coding-Paradox

I’m a developer deeply interested in **Systems Programming**, **Low Level Integeration**, and in general **Architectural Design Tasks**. I prefer building things from the ground up to understand how they work at the byte level.

---

### What I have built
* **[Discrete Math System Architecture]:** A Discrete Math Engine, build on memory efficient algorithms. The engine works on a pre-defined "Instruction Set" (that gets parsed), the system accepts commands, arguments as input, and processes them to generate accurate, and costrained results (if wanted).

---

### What I’m Building Right Now
* **[Custom Memory Allocator]:** A custom C++ allocator designed for [specific goal like "low-latency" or "learning memory layouts"], specially oriented for "game engine specific memory managment".
* **[Procedural Map Generation]:** Procedural world generation focusing on [specific detail like "algorithmic consistency", and "game design principles"].

---

### Core Interests & Research
* **Low-Level Systems:** Memory management, performance optimization, and understanding the "why" behind the code.
* **Mathematics, and Physics:** Turning mathematical tools, and assets into usable applications (practical aspect of physics, and research aspect of mathematics).
* **Developer Experience:** Building a streamlined workflow within **Neovim** and the terminal.

### My Environment & Tools
* **Languages:** C, C++
* **Editor:** Neovim (LSP, Mason, and a lot of custom config)
* **OS/Terminal:** PWSH v7 + Starship + Wezterm

"The best way to understand a system is to build a smaller, simpler version of it first."
